NUMBER GUESSING GAME
The fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to quess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:
1. The system generates a random number trom a given range, say I to 10u
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number
4. The game continues under the user guessing the number.
You can also incorporate further details as:
• Limiting the number of attempts.
• Adding more rounds.
• Displaying score.
• Giving points based on the number of attempts.
